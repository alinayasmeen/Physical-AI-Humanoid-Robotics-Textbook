# Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook", a documentation website built with Docusaurus. The textbook aims to teach students about AI systems that interact with the physical world, bridging the gap between AI and robotics.

## Key Technologies

*   **Docusaurus v3:** A modern static website generator for building documentation sites.
*   **React:** The underlying UI library for Docusaurus.
*   **TypeScript:** For type-safe code.
*   **Markdown:** The content for the textbook is written in Markdown files.

## Project Structure

The main content of the project is within the `my-textbook-site` directory.

*   `my-textbook-site/`: Contains the Docusaurus project.
    *   `docusaurus.config.ts`: The main configuration file for the Docusaurus site. It defines the site's title, navigation, plugins, and theme.
    *   `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts.
    *   `sidebars.ts`, `sidebarsCourse.ts`, `sidebarsLabs.ts`, `sidebarsCapstone.ts`: These files define the sidebar navigation for the different sections of the site.
    *   `course/`: Contains the Markdown files for the textbook chapters.
    *   `src/`: Contains custom React components and CSS for the site.
*   `specs/`: Contains the project's specifications, including the overall plan and feature requirements.
*   `history/`: Contains a history of prompts and architectural decisions, likely generated by an AI agent.

## Building and Running

To work with this project, you need to have Node.js and Yarn installed.

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd my-textbook-site
    yarn
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will open the website in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Build the static site:**
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
    The built files will be in the `my-textbook-site/build` directory.

4.  **Serve the built site:**
    ```bash
    yarn serve
    ```

## Development Conventions

The project follows a "Spec-Driven Development" process, where specifications and plans are created before implementation. The `specs` and `history` directories are a testament to this process.

The content is organized into different sections (`course`, `labs`, `capstone`) and the sidebars are mostly autogenerated from the directory structure. This means that to add a new chapter, you can simply add a new Markdown file in the appropriate directory.
