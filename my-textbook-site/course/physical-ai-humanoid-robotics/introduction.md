# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This textbook introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

## Focus and Theme
**AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.**

Our goal is to bridge the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students will apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

## Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
*   Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence.
*   Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control.
*   Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity.
*   Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform.
*   Design humanoid robots for natural interactions.
*   Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics.
