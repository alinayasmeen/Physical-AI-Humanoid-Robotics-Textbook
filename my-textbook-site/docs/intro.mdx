# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to this comprehensive course on **Physical AI** and **Humanoid Robotics**. This textbook guides you from foundational concepts of embodied intelligence through hands-on implementation of autonomous humanoid robot systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical embodiment. Unlike digital AI that operates purely in software, Physical AI systems must perceive, reason about, and act upon the real world through robotic bodies.

Key characteristics of Physical AI:
- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI that exists within and interacts through a physical form
- **Sensor-Motor Integration**: Connecting perception (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs) to action (motors, actuators)
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Processing sensor data and executing actions in milliseconds
- **Environmental Adaptation**: Responding to unpredictable physical conditions

## Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
2. **Build** ROS 2 systems with nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. **Design** humanoid robot models using URDF
4. **Simulate** robot behavior in Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
5. **Implement** perception pipelines for vision and sensor fusion
6. **Integrate** Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for natural language robot control
7. **Complete** a capstone project demonstrating autonomous humanoid behavior
