# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI embodies intelligence in physical forms, allowing it to perceive, reason, and act within real-world environments. This field combines robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory to create autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks.

## Why Humanoid Robotics?
Humanoid robotics focuses on creating robots that mimic the human form and capabilities. The pursuit of humanoid robots is driven by several factors:
- **Versatility**: Human-like form allows robots to operate in environments designed for humans.
- **Interaction**: Natural interaction with humans and human-made tools.
- **Research Platform**: Provides a complex platform for studying intelligence, locomotion, and manipulation.
