## Prompt

/sp.constitution
Project Title: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Primary Vision:
Teach students how AI systems transition from digital reasoning to embodied intelligence operating in the physical world. The book should bridge the gap between the AI “brain” and the robotic “body,” enabling learners to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots in realistic environments.

Foundational Principles:
1. Clarity and Pedagogy
   - Concepts must be written for students new to robotics and AI integration.
   - Each chapter includes diagrams, examples, and step-by-step explanations.

2. Technical Accuracy
   - Follow official standards of ROS 2 Humble/Iron, Gazebo Classic & Ignition, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Unity XR, and VLA (Vision-Language-Action) systems.

3. Embodied Intelligence Focus
   - Every topic connects to real robotic perception, control, locomotion, sensors, and physical interaction.

4. Hands-On Learning Philosophy
   - Students must be able to simulate, visualize, and deploy code on physical or simulated humanoid systems.

5. Accessibility + Inclusiveness
   - The textbook should support DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy) students, robotics learners, and AI developers.

6. Production-Ready Documentation
   - Clean Docusaurus structure with sidebars, navigation, search, dark/light mode, and GitHub Pages deployment.

7. End-to-End Capstone-Oriented
   - All modules flow toward the final “Autonomous Humanoid” capstone where a robot hears a voice command, plans, navigates, perceives, and manipulates.

8. High-Performance Computing Realism
   - Include guidance for both on-prem labs (RTX workstations) and cloud labs (AWS g5/g6e GPU instances).

9. Ethics + Safety
   - Include safety protocols, physical robot risk mitigation, fail-safes, and shutdown procedures.
