## Prompt

/sp.adr

## Response snapshot

✅ ADR Review Complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 Created ADRs: 6
   - ADR-0001: Documentation Platform and Structure
   - ADR-0002: Robotics Simulation and Integration Strategy
   - ADR-0003: RAG-Powered Chatbot Architecture
   - ADR-0004: Robotics Skill Agent Architecture
   - ADR-0005: LLM Cognitive Planning and Voice Command Integration
   - ADR-0006: Hardware and Cloud Simulation Environment Strategy

📚 Referenced Existing: 0

⚠️  Conflicts Detected: 0

Next Steps:
→ Review created ADRs with team
→ Update plan.md if needed

Acceptance Criteria (PASS only if all true)
- Decisions are clustered (not atomic), with explicit alternatives and tradeoffs
- Consequences cover both positive and negative outcomes
- References link back to plan and related docs


## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All identified architectural decisions from the plan are documented as ADRs.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: All 6 ADR files created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with quickstart guide or task generation (/sp.tasks) after ADR review.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully extracted, clustered, and documented architectural decisions as ADRs.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
