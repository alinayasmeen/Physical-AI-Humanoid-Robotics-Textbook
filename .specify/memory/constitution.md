# Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics-Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Clarity and Conciseness
All content, including code, documentation, and communication, must be clear, concise, and easily understandable. Avoid jargon where possible, and prioritize direct communication.

### Accuracy and Verifiability
All technical information, code examples, and scientific claims must be accurate and, where applicable, verifiable through empirical data or established principles. Provide sources for factual statements.

### Practical Application
Emphasize practical applications and real-world relevance. Code examples should be functional and demonstrate concepts effectively within the context of physical AI and humanoid robotics.

### Modularity and Reusability
Code should be modular, well-structured, and designed for reusability. Promote the creation of components that can be easily integrated into different projects within the domain.

### Safety and Ethics
Prioritize safety and ethical considerations in all aspects of physical AI and humanoid robotics. Discuss potential risks and responsible development practices.

### Continuous Improvement
Embrace continuous improvement through feedback loops, iterative development, and regular updates to reflect advancements in the field.

## Content Standards

All content must be original or properly attributed. Avoid plagiarism. Maintain a consistent tone and style throughout the textbook.

## Development Workflow

Follow a structured development workflow including peer review for code and content, version control (Git), and automated testing where applicable.

## Governance

This constitution outlines the fundamental principles governing the development of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook. Amendments require consensus from project leads and must be documented in an ADR.
