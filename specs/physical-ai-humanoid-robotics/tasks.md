# Tasks for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Implementation Strategy

This project will follow an incremental delivery approach, starting with core Docusaurus setup and foundational content scaffolding, followed by implementing each user story (chapter/module/feature) in priority order. The MVP for the website will include the basic Docusaurus structure, navigation, homepage, and initial content placeholders for all core chapters. Advanced features like the RAG chatbot and Robotics Skill Agent will be integrated in later phases.

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 (Setup) must be completed before Phase 2 (Foundational).
- Phase 2 (Foundational) must be completed before any User Story Phase (3-9).
- User Story 15 (RAG backend) should ideally precede User Story 14 (RAG frontend) for full functionality.
- User Story 16 (Robotics Skill Agent backend/frontend) has no strict dependency on other User Story phases, but benefits from established Docusaurus and backend patterns.
- Phase 10 (Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns) depends on the completion of all other phases.
